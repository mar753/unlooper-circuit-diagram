# unlooper-circuit-diagram

This is the Unlooper v2 circuit diagram created by me with a software which you can find in unlooper-microcontroller and unlooper-frequency-divider-glitch repos. Complete information and documentation (currently only in Polish) is available here [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4R8EDQrHOdiUXhEdDhwN3JZTjQ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4R8EDQrHOdiUXhEdDhwN3JZTjQ/view?resourcekey=0-BVje0iPdyUhrrLkYZI_NmA). If you have any questions feel free to ask.

You can reuse this picture, but please add a link to this repo.
